## Refactored Project

This Password Manager is a ground-up rewrite of a previous implementation that had scalability and maintainability limitations.

The new version focuses on:

- Clean architecture and modular design  
- Improved state handling and validation  
- Production-quality commit practices  
- Better performance and reliability  

This project reflects my current development standards and engineering maturity.
